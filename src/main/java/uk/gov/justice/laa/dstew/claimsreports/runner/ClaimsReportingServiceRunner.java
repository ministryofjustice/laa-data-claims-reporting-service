/**
 * The ClaimsReportingServiceRunner class is responsible for orchestrating the report generation process
 * for a collection of report services that extend the AbstractReportService.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class implements the ApplicationRunner interface, ensuring that the report generation is triggered
 * once the application context is fully initialized.
 *
 * <p>
 * Dependencies:
 * - A list of AbstractReportService implementations, where each implementation is tasked with handling
 *   the specific logic for refreshing materialized views and generating reports.
 *
 * <p>
 * Workflow:
 * - The `run` method is invoked at application startup and calls the internal `generateReports` method.
 * - The `generateReports` method iterates through the provided list of report services, ensuring each one
 *   performs the refresh of its associated materialized view and generates the corresponding report.
 *
 * <p>
 * Usage:
 * - This component is used as part of the Spring Boot application lifecycle to ensure reports are
 *   consistently generated during the application execution phase.
 * - The logic for refreshing materialized views and generating reports is delegated to the individual
 *   AbstractReportService implementations.

   * <p>
   * This method ensures that errors during the generation process for one service do not interfere
   * with the other services. If an exception occurs during the execution of a specific report service,
   * it logs an error message containing the name of the service and the details of the exception.

   * which provides the necessary methods for refreshing materialized views and generating reports.
