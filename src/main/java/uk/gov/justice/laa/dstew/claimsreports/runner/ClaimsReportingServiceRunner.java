/**
 * The ClaimsReportingServiceRunner class is responsible for orchestrating the report generation process
 * for a collection of report services that extend the AbstractReportService.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class implements the ApplicationRunner interface, ensuring that the report generation is triggered
 * once the application context is fully initialized.
 *
 * <p>
 * Dependencies:
 * - A list of AbstractReportService implementations, where each implementation is tasked with handling
 *   the specific logic for refreshing materialized views and generating reports.
 *
 * <p>
 * Workflow:
 * - The `run` method is invoked at application startup and calls the internal `ensureReplicationHealthy` method
 * - This checks if the database replication is healthy and all the data is in sync with the source DB.
 * - If so, it calls the `generateReports` method, if not, it logs an error, throws an exception and terminates the process.
 * - The `generateReports` method iterates through the provided list of report services, ensuring each one
 *   performs the refresh of its associated materialized view and generates the corresponding report.
 *
